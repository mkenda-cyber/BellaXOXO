        <h2>I don’t know how to say this without sounding dramatic but I miss you in ways words can’t fully explain.
I’m sitting here trying to focus nisome but my mind keeps drifting back to you and moments 🙈💕
Your smile, your voice na the way your presence calms me, yoooohh I crave it all wallah 😪😍
Every little thing reminds me of you, and somehow you’re always in the back of my mind, even when I try to distract myself this word Bestina inanijia kichwani 😭😭💔
It’s crazy how one person can be so far yet feel so close like you’re right here with me rn in every heartbeat….
I don’t just miss you… I feel the absence of us…
Can’t wait to hold you, kiss on lips to the neck, talk to you na laugh with you, just be with you ☹👩‍❤‍💋‍👨
Until then, just know you’re deeply loved and even more deeply missed.
Sleep well my love 💕💍</h2>
